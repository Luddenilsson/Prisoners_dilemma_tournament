## Prisoners Dilemma
The Prisoner's Dilemma is a concept in game theory where two individuals, facing criminal charges, must decide whether to cooperate or betray each other. The outcomes depend on their mutual choices. If both cooperate, they get a moderate sentence. If one betrays, they get a lighter sentence, but the other gets a harsher one. If both betray, they both get a somewhat harsh sentence. The dilemma highlights the conflict between individual and collective interests in decision-making.

## Iterated Prisoners Dilemma
In an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, the scenario is repeated over multiple rounds. Participants have the opportunity to remember the previous actions of their counterparts. This iterative nature introduces the possibility of building trust or responding reciprocally. Strategies can evolve as individuals adapt based on past interactions, fostering cooperation or competition over time. The dynamics of an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma often lead to more complex strategies and nuanced decision-making compared to a one-shot version.
